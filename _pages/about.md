Hi! I'm a computer science and Statistics student currently pursuing my degree at the University of California, San Diego, set to graduate in 2024. As I embark on the next phase of my academic journey, I am enthusiastically exploring internship and research opportunities that align with my interests, particularly in the fields of AI/machine learning/Robotics, full-stack web or mobile development.

In addition to my primary focus, I have a genuine curiosity for various other domains, such as VR/AR and data analysis, and I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas. The ever-increasing integration of computers into people's lives has captivated me, driving my passion for computer science. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of digital tools that simplify and enhance everyone's lives, making them easier, simpler, and ultimately happier.

Feel free to explore my personal website to learn more about my journey, projects, and experiences. I'm always open to exciting opportunities and collaborations, so don't hesitate to reach out. Let's create a better digital future together!
